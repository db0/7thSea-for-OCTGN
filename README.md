Currently 7th Sea does not utilize OCTGN auto-generated proxies to play. You'll need to download the card image packs to be able to play.

The link below will provide you with a download bundle you can import into OCTGN by the "add o8c" function in the game manager

A lot of images in this bundle are built manually off of templates. In the future I hope I'll be adding proper high quality scans as they are procured and will provide a download link here.

Unfortunately there's not much of a community remaining around the 7th Sea CCG actively found playing games on OCTGN. However there is a small responsive group in the [7th Sea CCG Players Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2233394568/) and additional resources at [The 7th Sea CCG Fan Page](7thsea.info). You can also find this game's [Board Game Geek page](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3125/7th-sea-collectible-card-game) here.

Hopefully, with the game being playable on OCTGN, we might be able to rejuvenate the community and teach new people to play. So please **do** speak up if you're around ;)
